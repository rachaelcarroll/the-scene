## Overview

Perhaps you've been invited on a date with a musician, or you've found yourself at a party of hipsters who love to chat music, or maybe you just want to find a new genre or two. Well, friend, you're in luck... the<i>scene</i> takes the effort out of sounding *hip* in the music scene and kicks off the conversation for you.  

the<i>scene</i> was built with React, using the [The Genrenator API](https://binaryjazz.us/wp-json/genrenator/v1/story/) to display a random genre and story to shuffle through and save to favorites. This application was built as the final solo project of Mod3 at [Turing](turing.edu).  The goal was to build an application for a niche audience using React, React Router, a third party API, and Cypress.
